      I have been a software engineer at
      <a href="http://www.buildium.com/" target="_blank">Buildium</a>,
      a property management SaaS company, since 2014. We use C# on top of MySQL,
      and Angular on the front end.

      I'm currently a senior engineer on the mobile team, and have been helping
      spearhead the move to a microservices architecture in AWS. I also run the
      production monitoring team and serve on the architecture review board.
      Previously I've worked on a cross-functional team that extended and
      supported the <a href="https://www.buildium.com/features/lease-management/"
      target="_blank">
      core features</a> of the application and built
      <a href="https://www.buildium.com/features/tenant-screening/"
      target="_blank">add-on services</a> and
        <a href="https://www.buildium.com/features/renters-insurance-plus/"
        target="_blank">integrations with 3rd party partners</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm interestedin distributed systems, domain driven design, and using code
       to make art. I like to have decent familiarity with the full stack, even
       if backend development is my real area of expertise, and I consider
       deployment and infrastructure part of my code.
    </p>
     <p>
       In summer 2014, I graduated from <a href="http://www.launchacademy.com/"
       target="_blank">
         Launch Academy</a>, a Ruby on Rails-focused dev bootcamp. Before that,
         I did some data visualisation and analysis as well as static web design
          as a consultant for early-stage startups.

     <p>
       I graduated from the University of Chicago in spring 2011 with a degree
       in History, English, and Creative Writing.
