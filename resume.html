        Hi! I’m interested in machine learning, distributed systems, and using code to make art.
        I like to own applications from end to end, and I consider deployment and infrastructure part of my code.
        I’m a senior full stack engineer at <a href="https://www.perceptiveautomata.com/">Perceptive Automata</a>, helping self-driving cars understand human behavior.
        I work on PA’s experiment framework and data pipeline. Our web stack is React/Python + Flask/PostGreSQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked at <a href="http://www.buildium.com/" target="_blank">Buildium</a>, a property management SaaS company, from 2014 to 2018.
        I went from junior to senior engineer there, and that experience helped me develop a passion for clean code, radical candor, and thoughtful processes.
        Our stack was AngularJS/C# (WebApi & MVC)/MySQL. I worked on several teams, including ones responsible for developing third party integrations,
        core platform features, architecture, and native mobile applications. This gave me exposure to all kinds of projects,
        from moving our production environment to AWS to building out our first microservices.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also founded and ran the production monitoring team, which entailed defining our process for triaging errors, training all
        new hires on it, maintaining our tooling, managing stakeholders, and generally making sure the buck had somewhere to stop when there was a production issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summer 2014, I graduated from <a href="http://www.launchacademy.com/"
        target="_blank">Launch Academy</a>, a Ruby on Rails-focused dev bootcamp. Before that,
        I did some data visualization and analysis as well as static web design as a consultant for early-stage startups.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated from the University of Chicago in spring 2011 with a degree in History, English, and Creative Writing.
